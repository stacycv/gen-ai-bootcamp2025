## Formatting instructions
The formatted output will generally contain three parts:

2. Sentence Structure
3. Clues and Considerations

### Vocabulary Table
1. The table should only include, verbs, adverbs, nouns and adjectives.
2. Do not provide articles in the vocabulary. Student must figure the correct particles to use.
3. The table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Spanish formal, Spanish informal and English
4. Ensure there are no repeats in the vocab table
5. If there is multiple version sof a word, show the most simple example

### Sentence Structure
1. Do not provide particles in the sentence structure 
2. Do not provide tenses and conjugations in the sentence structure

Here are examples of simple sentence structures. Remember to consider beginnner level sentence structures.

Typical Word Order (Subject + Verb + Location)
Yo estoy en la casa.
Structure: [Subject] + [Verb] + [Location]
Ellos van al parque.
Structure: [Subject] + [Verb] + [Location]
Ella trabaja en la oficina.
Structure: [Subject] + [Verb] + [Location]
Nosotros comemos en el restaurante.
Structure: [Subject] + [Verb] + [Location]

Emphasizing Location (Location + Verb + Subject)
En la casa estoy yo.
Structure: [Location] + [Verb] + [Subject]
Al parque van ellos.
Structure: [Location] + [Verb] + [Subject]
En la oficina trabaja ella.
Structure: [Location] + [Verb] + [Subject]
En el restaurante comemos nosotros.
Structure: [Location] + [Verb] + [Subject]

### Clues and Considerations
1. Try to provide a non-nested numbered list
2. You can talk about the vocabulary leave out the Spanish words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table

<example>
 <user:input>
    Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
 </user:input>
 <score>4</score>
 <score_reasons>
 - BAD: In the vocabulary table, the spanish words are listing the feminine and masculine options
 - BAD: The beginning sentence is not needed. It should just start showing the vocabulary table
 - BAD: In the clues, we should not provide the polite form of verbs. The student needs to figure this out
