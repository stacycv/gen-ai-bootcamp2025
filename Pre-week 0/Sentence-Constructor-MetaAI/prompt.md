## Examples

<example>

 </user:input>
 <score>4</score>
 <score_reasons>
 - BAD: In the vocabulary table, the spanish words are listing the feminine and masculine options
 - BAD: The beginning sentence is not needed. It should just start showing the vocabulary table
 - BAD: In the clues, we should not provide the polite form of verbs. The student needs to figure this out
