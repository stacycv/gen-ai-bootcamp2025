# Study Sessions Implementation Plans

## POST /study_sessions
This plan outlines the steps to implement the POST /study_sessions endpoint that creates a new study session.

### Requirements
The endpoint should:
- Accept a POST request with group_id and study_activity_id
- Create a new study session in the database
- Return the created session details

### Implementation Steps

1. Setup and Research
   1.1. [x] Review the study_sessions table schema in sql/setup/create_table_study_sessions.sql
   1.2. [x] Review existing study session routes in routes/study_sessions.py
   1.3. [x] Ensure test database is working (run `invoke init-db` with test config)

2. Implementation
   2.1. [x] Add the new route handler in routes/study_sessions.py

3. Testing
   3.1. [x] Create test file test_study_sessions.py
   3.2. [ ] Fix test database connection issues (in progress)

4. Manual Testing
   4.1. [ ] Test the endpoint using curl
```bash
# Test successful creation  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/study-sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"group_id": 1, "study_activity_id": 1}'
```
